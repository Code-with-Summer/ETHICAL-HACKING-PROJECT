# ETHICAL-HACKING-PROJECT
The purpose of this project is to simulate real-world network penetration testing and defense mechanisms using vulnerable virtual environments and professional-grade tools. It focuses on replicating how attackers scan, enumerate, exploit, and compromise networked systems and how defenders can detect, respond to, and remediate these actions.
